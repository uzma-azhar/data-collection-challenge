This is my submission for the module 11 challenge. The Mars_Code folder includes:
- Deliverable 1: A Jupyter notebook containing code that scrapes the Mars news titles and preview text.

        - How many months exist on Mars?
        - How many Martian days' worth of data are there?
        - Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest?
        - Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest?
        - How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year? A visual estimate within 25% was made.
